                                <p> We realised that India really is way behind other countries when it comes to community service. Community Service has a very generalised view and can be done anywhere. Soon we had figured out a way to make our sundays more productive and came up with a platform where like minded set of people could meet each other and start a goal. Each time someone starts a goal , Theres's points attatched for the task and a leaderboard where all these people could compete and at the same time provide more and more to the society thus making their free time a lot more meaningful. Also once the user attains a specific set of points he/she should be rewarded with vouchers or money hence inspiring them to do more for the society . The bussiness model is pretty much all about our sponsers who provide merchandise for the completion of the task and in return it's a win win when our sponsors get advertised in the real world for something that helps make the world we live in , a better place.</p>
