#Idealogy
After a lot of brainstorming throughout the ideation phase we tried to identify problems that we face in our daily life and gave a thought to the fact how could we use our development skills to solve the problem. We realised that India really is way behind other countries when it comes to community service. Community Service has a very generalised view and can be done anywhere.
Soon we had figured out a way to make our sundays more productive and came up with a platform where like minded set of people could meet each other and start a goal. Each time someone starts a goal , Theres's points attatched for the task and a leaderboard where all these people could compete and at the same time provide more and more to the society thus making their free time a lot more meaningful. Also once the user attains a specific set of points he/she should be rewarded with vouchers or money hence inspiring them to do more for the society .
The bussiness model is pretty much all about our sponsers who provide merchandise for the completion of the task  and in return it's a win win when our sponsors get advertised in the real world for something that helps make the world we live in , a better place.
